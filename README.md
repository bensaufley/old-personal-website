This is the git repo for my personal website. It's pretty bare-bones at the moment, but it's better than the Wordpress site that had been stagnating in its place since at least 2013.

It's a static site generator built using Gulp, Pug, SASS, Babel, etc. Obviously, it's inspired by other static site generators like Jekyll, Hexio, and Middleman, but I wanted to take a crack at building something myself – both as a code exercise, and as a means of having a better understanding of the environment I was using.

The price of customizability in the wide range of tools out there – which offer things like themes, many varieties of page types, and so on – is added complexity, and I didn't feel like I needed that complexity to accomplish what I needed.
